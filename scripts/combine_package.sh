# Script CPack archives with specified platform and configuration. After
# packing all files extracted to single release directory.
# Usage:
#     combine_package <project-name> <configuration> <platform> <version> [no-tls] [static]
# where:
#     project-name    - The name of target project package
#     configuration   - Debug or Release
#     platform        - x86 or x64
#     version         - version of application i.e. 1.2.6
#     no-tls          - build without TLS support
#     static          - build static library, samples and tests (without TLS support)
