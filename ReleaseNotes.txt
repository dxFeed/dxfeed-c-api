* [DXFC-189] Fixed a bug with inability to receive (API does not publish) orders with Scope = Aggregate

Version 5.12.0
* [DXFC-185] The new order source for cboe C2 options was added: C2OX
* [DXFC-188] Fixed a bug with concurrent call of `tls_init` function

Version 5.11.0
* [DXFC-182] The new order (price level) sources were added: ntv, glbx, xeur
* [DXFC-178] Added the ability to log received and transmitted data blocks
  - [API] Added the new function `dxf_initialize_logger_v2` with additional parameter `log_data_transfer`(compare with `dxf_initialize_logger` function).
    This flag defining the logging mode; if it's nonzero then the data transfer (portions of received and sent data) logging will be enabled.
    It will also create two files with names similar to the name of the main log file, but ending with "*.receive.data" and "*.send.data"
  - [Samples] Added the additional command line parameters:
    - `-p` - Enables the data transfer logging
    - `-o` - Sets the program timeout in seconds (default = 604800, i.e a week)

Version 5.10.0
* [DXFC-174] Added the ability to subscribe to regional quotes. Now Quote subscription requests both composite and regional events. Please, use the `scope` field to filter events.
* [DXFC-168] The list of supported order sources was updated: NTV,NFX,ESPD,XNFI,ICE,ISE,DEA,DEX,BYX,BZX,BATE,CHIX,CEUX,BXTR,IST,BI20,ABE,FAIR,GLBX,ERIS,XEUR,CFE,SMFE
* [DXFC-136] Fixed error erasure on repeated snapshot creation with same parameters
  - Changed `dx_perform_common_actions` to use `resetError` flag
  - Added internal `dx_close_subscription` function to implement `resetError` flag usage

Version 5.9.0
* Added the ability to override the type of data the application subscribes to
  - Added the API functions: `dxf_create_subscription_with_flags` and `dxf_create_subscription_timed_with_flags` which accept an additional parameter `subscr_flags`.
    - Use `dx_esf_force_ticker` flag to force subscription to ticker data
    - Use `dx_esf_force_stream` flag to force subscription to stream data
    - Use `dx_esf_force_history` flag to force subscription to history data
  - [Samples] Added an additional command line parameter "[-s <subscr_data>]" to CommandLineSample (to describe how to use the new function with flags). This parameter accepts the next values:
    - TICKER to force subscription to ticker data
    - STREAM to force subscription to stream data
    - HISTORY to force subscription to history data
* Added the candle price level attribute support. The candle price level (pl) defines additional axis to split candles within particular price corridor in addition to candle period attribute with the default value Double.NaN.
  So a one-minute candles of "AAPL" with price level 0.1 shall be specified with "AAPL{=m,pl=0.1}".
  Example: `CandleSample demo.dxfeed.com:7300 AAPL{=m,pl=0.1} -t 2020-01-01`
* Added ability to retrieve regional TnS. Now API backend (C-API) subsribes to both composite and regional TimeAndSale events. Sometimes server may sent equal composite and regional TnS which differ by suffix only (for example: TimeAndSale and TimeAndSale&K). So the `scope` field was added with possible values: dxf_osc_composite and dxf_osc_regional. Same field was added for Summary events. Please, use the `scope` field to filter out duplicates.

Version 5.8.0
* Improved the documentation (converted to doxygen format)

Version 5.7.0
