Version 8.6.0
* [DXFC-297] Improved the handling of transaction flags and signs of transaction flags.

Version 8.5.3
* [DXFC-137] Fixed a bug where it was not possible to create a snapshot due to a collision of snapshot keys.
* Fixed a bug with debug logging of the `dxf_get_last_error` function.
* Fixed a potential bug when static data of record field setters  were not in thread local storage.

Version 8.5.2
* Fixed a potential bug with flags that were not in thread local storage

Version 8.5.1
* [DXFC-276] Fixed a bug with broken wildcard subscription

Version 8.5.0
* [DXFC-274] The repeated call to load the configuration from a file or line does not return errors and does not raise any exceptions.
  Also added error codes for some situations when reading configurations:
  - dx_cfgec_empty_config_string = 105
  - dx_cfgec_empty_config_file_name = 106
  - dx_cfgec_toml_parser_error = 107
  When logging, dx_cfgec_toml_parser_error will be accompanied by more detailed information about the parsing error.
* Fixed some minor bugs after adding LGTM and CodeQL checks
* The win sockets version is set to 2.2.*
* [Attention] Some architectural issues have been discovered that impose restrictions on the use of connection objects.
  It is not recommended to use multiple connections in parallel in the same process. This applies to structures\objects created with
  `dxf_create_connection`, `dxf_create_connection_auth_basic`, `dxf_create_connection_auth_bearer`, `dxf_create_connection_auth_custom`.
  This limitation will be lifted after API design changes.

Version 8.4.1
* [DXFC-261] Fixed a bug related to leaking socket handles
* [samples] Added `-r` parameter to CommandLineSample to enable connection reestablishment mechanism.

Version 8.4.0
* [DXFC-260] Fixed names of event fields for reading candledata.
* [samples] Added header for enabling NULL macros.

Version 8.3.0
* [DXFC-254] The amount of memory used to store the symbols required for a subscription has been reduced by several times.
  [Deprecated] `dxf_get_last_event` is deprecated and will be removed in version 9.0.0, since this mechanism consumes a lot of RAM.
  Please save the latest event by symbol and type to achieve this functionality. The `subscriptions.disableLastEventStorage` configuration property was added.
  It allows to disable the last event storage mechanism. Default value = true. This property will be also removed in version 9.0.0.
  How to enable the last event storage mechanism:
  ```c
  dxf_load_config_from_wstring(L"subscriptions.disableLastEventStorage = false\n");
  ```

Version 8.2.0
* [DXFC-252] Fixed bug with "freezing" the dxf_close_connection `function` if not called immediately after disconnecting the connection.  
  The `network.reestablishConnections` config property was added. This property describes a flag that allows to disable the connection reestablishment mechanism. (default value = true).  
  An example of disabling:  
  ```c
  dxf_load_config_from_wstring(L"network.reestablishConnections = false\n");
  ```

Version 8.1.0
* [DXFC-251] Fixed a bug with receiving gap-filling data every time the user subscribed to symbols that he had already subscribed to earlier.

  and `smfe` (SmallEx' price level source)
* Improved the CommandLineSample: the cross-platform synchronization primitives were added.

Version 8.0.1
* [DXFC-236] Fixed the ancient glitch with random garbage data in fields of removed events' (TX_REMOVE flag = 1).

Version 8.0.0
* [DXFC-231] [Breaking changes] Converted the types and representations of certain event fields to store WideDecimal
  - Fields that are now of type `double`: `dxf_order_t.size`, `dxf_order_t.count`, `dxf_trade_t.size`, `dxf_trade_eth_t.size`,
    `dxf_quote_t.bid_size`, `dxf_quote_t.ask_size`, `dxf_summary_t.open_interest`, `dxf_profile_t.div_freq`,
    `dxf_time_and_sale_t.size`, `dxf_candle_t.open_interest`
  - Added the `dxf_order_t.executed_size` (`dxf_double_t`) field which is related to FOB support
* [DXFC-222] Added the new `dxf_create_price_level_book_v2` function with an easier way (for Python and .NET API) to
  pass a list of sources (pair of parameters: `const char** sources` and `int sources_count`)

Version 7.6.0
* [DXFC-224] Fixed a bug with a race conditions occurred while reading files
* [DXFC-225] Added initial support for the WideDecimal type. This will allow reading data coming from CandleWebService
  or data recorded in `tape` format. The examples of usage added to CommandLineSample and CandleSample help output.
* Now heartbeat logging in the CommandLineSample is optional. To enable, you must use the `-b` flag.

Version 7.3.0
* [DXFC-218] Improved the SnapshotConsoleSample
  - the `date` (-t) parameter was added. Format: DD-MM-YYYY, default value: current date and time.
    Previously, without this parameter, the time was set equal to 0 (01-01-1970)!
  - the cross-platform synchronization primitives were added
* [DXFC-219] Fixed a bug with broken parsing of negative values
* [DXFC-202] Added the ability to filter log messages by level
  The `logger.level` config property was added. This property describes a minimum logging level.
  Possible values: "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace". Default value = "info"
  An example of limiting the output of logs:
  ```c
  dxf_load_config_from_wstring(L"logger.level = \"error\"\n");
  ```

Version 7.2.0
* All sample programs were moved to the `samples` directory
* [DXFC-212] Extended the Order event for Full Order Book
  - the `action`, `action_time`, `order_id`, `aux_order_id`, `trade_id`, `trade_price`, `trade_size` fields were added to the `dxf_order_t` structure
    See the `dxf_order_action_t` enum description (documentation) where it is indicated in which cases which fields will be filled.
  - the FullOrderBook sample was added.
* [DXFC-211] Fixed a bug with broken construction of order snapshots (books), based on Quote (order scope = Composite|Regional) & MarketMaker (order scope = Aggregate) events
* Improved the `dxf_event_listener_t` & `dxf_event_listener_t_v2` documentation
* The `data_count` parameter of `dxf_event_listener_t` & `dxf_event_listener_t_v2` listeners has been deprecated (it always returns 1). It will be removed in 8.0.0 version

Version 7.1.0
* [DXFC-209] Implemented the heartbeat semantics with payload
  - Added the new function `dxf_set_on_server_heartbeat_notifier(dxf_connection_t connection, dxf_conn_on_server_heartbeat_notifier_t notifier, void* user_data)`
    that sets a server heartbeat notifier's callback to the connection.
    This notifier will be invoked when the new heartbeat arrives from a server and contains non empty payload

    Function parameters:
      - connection - The handle of a previously created connection
      - notifier   - The notifier callback function pointer
      - user_data  - The data to be passed to the callback function

  - Added the new callback type of connection incoming heartbeat notification `dxf_conn_on_server_heartbeat_notifier_t`

    Passed parameters:
      - connection      - The connection handle
      - server_millis   - The server time in milliseconds (from the incoming heartbeat payload)
      - server_lag_mark - The server's messages composing lag time in microseconds (from the incoming heartbeat payload)
      - connection_rtt  - The calculated connection RTT in microseconds
      - user_data       - The user data passed to dxf_set_on_server_heartbeat_notifier

    An example of implementation:
    ```c
    void on_server_heartbeat_notifier(dxf_connection_t connection, dxf_long_t server_millis, dxf_int_t server_lag_mark,
        dxf_int_t connection_rtt, void* user_data)
    {
        fwprintf(stderr, L"\n##### Server time (UTC) = %" PRId64 " ms, Server lag = %d us, RTT = %d us #####\n",
            server_millis, server_lag_mark, connection_rtt);
    }
    ```

  See usage example in the CommandLineSample.c

Version 7.0.0
* [DXFC-175] [Breaking changes] Extended the Trade and Profile events to support additional fields from QD records
  - the `_52_high_price` & `_52_low_price` `Profile` event fields were renamed to `high_52_week_price` &
    `low_52_week_price` respectively
  - the `change` field was added to `TradeETH` event
* [DXFC-207] Extended the Trade and TradeETH events with new field dayId
  - the `day_id` field was added to the `dx_trade_t`, `dx_trade_eth_t` and `dxf_trade_t` structures.
    `day_id` - identifier of the day that `Trade` or `TradeETH` represents. Identifier of the day is the number of
    days passed since January 1, 1970.
* [DXFC-181] Extended the Underlying and Series events with putVolume and callVolume fields
  - the `call_volume` and `put_volume` fields were added to the `dx_series_t`, `dxf_series_t`, `dx_underlying_t`
    and `dxf_underlying_t` structures.
    `call_volume` - call options traded volume for a day. `put_volume` - put options traded volume for a day
  - the `option_volume` field was added to the `dxf_series_t`, `dxf_underlying_t` structures.
    `option_volume` - options traded volume  for a day.
* [DXFC-176] [Samples] Subscription methods are now called in a more correct order. Fixed output of hostnames.
* [DXFC-208] Added the ability to configure client\server heartbeat parameters
  - The default heartbeat period (DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD) is set to 10 seconds. Which corresponds to the defaults
    of Java API. The default heartbeat timeout remains the same (120 seconds).
  - Added the ability to load a configuration from a file or a string:
    The config file sample: [Sample](https://github.com/dxFeed/dxfeed-c-api/blob/master/dxfeed-api-config.sample.toml)
    The config file properties:
    - `network.heartbeatPeriod` -- The period between sending heartbeat messages (default value = 10 seconds)
    - `network.heartbeatTimeout` -- Timeout for receiving messages from the server, after which the api tries to
      change the server and/or reconnect (default value = 120 seconds)
  - Added the new function `dxf_load_config_from_file(const char* file_name)` that initializes the C-API configuration
    and loads a config (in TOML format) from a file.
      - `file_name` -- The config (in TOML format) file name
  - Added the new function `dxf_load_config_from_string(const char* config)` that initializes the C-API configuration
    and loads a config (in TOML format) from a string.
      - `config` -- The config (in TOML format) string
  - Added the new function `dxf_load_config_from_wstring(dxf_const_string_t config)` that initializes the C-API configuration
    and loads a config (in TOML format) from a wide string (dxf_const_string_t)
      - `config` -- The config (in TOML format) string

  For the successful application of the configuration, these functions must be called before creating any connection.
  Examples of using functions can be found in their descriptions and in the generated documentation.

  - [API] Added the new function `dxf_initialize_logger_v2` with additional parameter `log_data_transfer`(compare with `dxf_initialize_logger` function).
    This flag defining the logging mode; if it's nonzero then the data transfer (portions of received and sent data) logging will be enabled.
    It will also create two files with names similar to the name of the main log file, but ending with "*.receive.data" and "*.send.data"
  - [Samples] Added the additional command line parameters:
    - `-p` - Enables the data transfer logging

    - Use `dx_esf_force_stream` flag to force subscription to stream data
    - Use `dx_esf_force_history` flag to force subscription to history data
  - [Samples] Added an additional command line parameter "[-s <subscr_data>]" to CommandLineSample (to describe how to use the new function with flags). This parameter accepts the next values:
    - TICKER to force subscription to ticker data
    - STREAM to force subscription to stream data
    - HISTORY to force subscription to history data
* Added the candle price level attribute support. The candle price level (pl) defines additional axis to split candles within particular price corridor in addition to candle period attribute with the default value Double.NaN.
  So a one-minute candles of "AAPL" with price level 0.1 shall be specified with "AAPL{=m,pl=0.1}".
  Example: `CandleSample demo.dxfeed.com:7300 AAPL{=m,pl=0.1} -t 2020-01-01`
* Added ability to retrieve regional TnS. Now API backend (C-API) subsribes to both composite and regional TimeAndSale events. Sometimes server may sent equal composite and regional TnS which differ by suffix only (for example: TimeAndSale and TimeAndSale&K). So the `scope` field was added with possible values: dxf_osc_composite and dxf_osc_regional. Same field was added for Summary events. Please, use the `scope` field to filter out duplicates.
