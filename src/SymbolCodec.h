/*
 * The PentaCodec performs symbol coding and serialization using
 * extensible 5-bit encoding. The eligible characters are assigned penta codes
 * (either single 5-bit or double 10-bit) according to the following table:
 *
 * 'A' to 'Z'                 - 5-bit pentas from 1 to 26
 * '.'                        - 5-bit penta 27
 * '/'                        - 5-bit penta 28
 * '$'                        - 5-bit penta 29
 * ''' and '`'                - none (ineligible characters)
 * ' ' to '~' except above    - 10-bit pentas from 960 to 1023
 * all other                  - none (ineligible characters)
 *
 * The 5-bit penta 0 represents empty space and is eligible only at the start.
 * The 5-bit pentas 30 and 31 are used as a transition mark to switch to 10-bit pentas.
 * The 10-bit pentas from 0 to 959 do not exist as they collide with 5-bit pentas.
 *
 * The individual penta codes for character sequence are packed into 64-bit value
 * from high bits to low bits aligned to the low bits. This allows representation
 * of up to 35-bit penta-coded character sequences. If some symbol contains one or
 * more ineligible characters or does not fit into 35-bit penta, then it is not
 * subject to penta-coding and is left as a string. The resulting penta-coded value
 * can be serialized as defined below or encoded into the 32-bit cipher if possible.
 * Please note that penta code 0 is a valid code as it represents empty character
 * sequence - do not confuse it wich cipher value 0, which means 'void' or 'null'.
 *
 * The following table defines used serial format (the first byte is given in bits
 * with 'x' representing payload bit; the remaining bytes are given in bit count):
 *
 * 0xxxxxxx  8x - for 15-bit pentas
 * 10xxxxxx 24x - for 30-bit pentas
 * 110xxxxx ??? - reserved (payload TBD)
 * 1110xxxx 16x - for 20-bit pentas
 * 11110xxx 32x - for 35-bit pentas
 * 111110xx ??? - reserved (payload TBD)
 * 11111100 zzz - for UTF-8 string with length in bytes
 * 11111101 zzz - for CESU-8 string with length in characters
 * 11111110     - for 0-bit penta (empty symbol)
 * 11111111     - for void (null)
 *
 * See "http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr26/tr26-2.html"
 * for format basics and writeUTFString and writeCharArray
 * for details of string encoding.
